     Both synchronous and asynchronous modes of operation are supported:
     
     - use [[connect]] to block until the socket is connected, or
     - use [[connectAsync]] to register a listener that will be invoked when
       the socket is connected.
     
     You create new socket connectors with [[newSocketConnector]].
