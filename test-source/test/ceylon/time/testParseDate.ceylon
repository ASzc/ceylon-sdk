 * Representations can be done in one of two formats â€“ a basic format with a minimal number of 
 * separators or an extended format with separators added to enhance human readability.[5] 
 * The standard notes that "The basic format should be avoided in plain text."[6] The separator 
 * used between date values (year, month, week, and day) is the hyphen, while the colon is used 
 * as the separator between time values (hours, minutes, and seconds). For example, the 6th day 
 * of the 1st month of the year 2009 may be written as "2009-01-06" in the extended format or 
 * simply as "20090106" in the basic format without ambiguity.

 * representations, but in the order from the least to the most significant. For example, "2004-05" 
 * is a valid ISO 8601 date, which indicates May (the fifth month) 2004. This format will never 
 * represent the 5th day of an unspecified month in 2004, nor will it represent a time-span extending
